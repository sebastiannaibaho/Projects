# Projects
Please refer to the attachments in this directory to view examples of some of my past work! Samples include cases of time series modeling, statistical machine learning, and text-based machine learning. These were all completed primarily using R and Python. All relevant code can be found either included along the course of a project or in an appendix at the end of each file.
